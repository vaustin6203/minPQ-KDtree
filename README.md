# Extrinsic MinPQ & K-D Tree
I built an Extrinsic MinPQ, which is a priority queue that uses a min Heap as its underlying data structure. All functions for this data structure run in O(log N) time.
I also built a K-D Tree, where given a coordinate, it will find the nearest point in the tree in O(log N) time.
